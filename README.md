### Sequence to Sequence Examples
I am using Keras API for implementing RNN based models such as **LSTM**, **GRU** and **Attention** based models etc.

**Following are the examples:**
- Sequence Classification (Sentiment Classification for Movie reviews [Good/Bad])
- Machine Translation (English to Hindi)
Model accuracy is quite low. It may be because of less training examples.
The dataset is downloaded from http://www.manythings.org/anki/
